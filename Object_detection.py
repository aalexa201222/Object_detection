    ### How It Works

    This is an object detection application using a pre-trained MobileNetSSD model. The model has been trained to detect
    20 different objects, including aeroplane, bicycle, bird, boat, bottle, bus, car, cat, chair, cow, dining table, dog,
    horse, motorbike, person, potted plant, sheep, sofa, train, and TV monitor.

    When you upload an image, the application will run the object detection model on the image and display the original
    image along with bounding boxes around the detected objects and their confidence scores.

    ### Note
    Please make sure to upload an image file (e.g., JPG, JPEG, PNG) for the application to work correctly.
